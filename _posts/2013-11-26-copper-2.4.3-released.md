COPPER 2.4.3 is the latest stable release. Here' what's new:

- New feature: engine.run throws DuplicateIdException if an existing workflow instance id is used - this is also implemented for the transient engine which substitutes throwing an IllegalStateException
- New feature: Default value for property "loadNonWorkflowClasses" in "FileBasedWorkflowRepository" changed from false to true, due to various problems, e.g. Switch-case not working out-of-the-box
- Bugfix: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and other exceptions during workflow instrumentation when extensively using nested blocks and local variables
