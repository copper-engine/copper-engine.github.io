As you can see, we completely revamped our [copper-engine.org](http://copper-engine.org) website. :) Take a look around!

The site is now made with pure [Bootstrap 3.0](http://getbootstrap.com/) and is served by the [Jekyll templating engine](http://jekyllrb.com/) on [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) *(more on GitHub in our [next post]({% post_url 2013-12-09-now-on-github %}))*.

Not everything is quite there yet, [documentation](/docs/) is still lacking, but we're working on it! We'll post it here whenever we make some new content available.

Stay tuned!
