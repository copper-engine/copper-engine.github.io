**We moved the source code from Google Code to GitHub:**
**Now it's here: [https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine](https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine)**

Google Code served us well one year now, but we found that GitHub has some very attractive features: better issue and release management, free webspace (GitHub pages), a nicer wiki. Plus, of course, the first-class support for Git, the new version control behemoth we all love.

So, we removed all content from the old Google code site and moved it to GitHub. The new issue tracker is [here](https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine/issues), and all documentation went to our new [website](http://copper-engine.org/docs/).

Please let us know if anything is missing! E-mail to [contact@copper-engine.org](mailto:contact@copper-engine.org).
