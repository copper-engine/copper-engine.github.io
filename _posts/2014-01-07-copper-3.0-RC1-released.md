Besides some new functional features, one main issue of the 3.0 release is the renaming of COPPER's toplevel package to `org.copperengine`.

To make migration of existing applications easy, persistent workflow instances and responses in existing databases keep compatible due to a loadtime adaptation feature - see StandardJavaSerializer.classnameReplacement
