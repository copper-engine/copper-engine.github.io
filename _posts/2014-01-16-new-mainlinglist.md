The COPPER project now has a mailing list, hosted by Google Groups:

[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/copper-engine](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/copper-engine)

The mailing list is intended as a forum for both users and developers. All current COPPER developers are signed up.

The list members discuss general and technical issues around current and future COPPER releases. New users are always welcome! Don't hesitate to ask the developers any questions!

You can subscribe to this list either by using the Google Groups website or, if you don't want to create a Google account, by sending an e-mail to [copper-engine+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:copper-engine+subscribe@googlegroups.com) with topic "subscribe". Or, if that doesn't work, simply e-mail us at [contact@copper-engine.org](mailto:contact@copper-engine.org) and we'll sign you up.
