We are proud to announce that COPPER 5.0.0-alpha1 has just been released.
It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine/releases/tag/v5.0.0-alpha1) and in [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.copper-engine%22%20AND%20v%3A%225.0.0-alpha1%22).

COPPER has been upgraded to ASM 6.1, so Java 9 and 10 are now supported in addition to Java 8.
This release no longer supports Java 7 or older versions.

We also added support for the [Java Platform Module System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System) in order to let you build modular applications.
However, if you don't need this feature, you can use COPPER the same way as before.
