COPPER 5.0 has just been released and is ready for Java 11.
It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine) and in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.copper-engine%20AND%20a:copper-coreengine&core=gav).

COPPER has been upgraded to ASM 6.1, so Java 9, 10 and 11 are now supported in addition to Java 8.
This release no longer supports Java 7 or older versions.

COPPER 5.0 adds support for the [Java Platform Module System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System) in order to let you build modular applications.
However, if you don't need this feature, you can use COPPER the same way as before.

We are also proud to announce the first release of our new [Monitoring UI for COPPER](https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-monitoring/blob/master/README.md), which is written as a modern single page application with Vue.js as JavaScript framework and communicating with the COPPER engine(s) via a JMX-REST Bridge (Jolokia). Note that for the UI to work, your engine needs to be on that 5 release.

Another addition to this release is [a demo project](https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-modular-demo/blob/master/README.md) showing how to build a modular application with Java 11 and COPPER 5.
It provides a  Gradle script for creating a custom runtime image of this application.
