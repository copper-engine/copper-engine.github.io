Getting started
=================

copper-starter ist a getting started project for the cooper-engine. (https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-starter)
It demonstrates some main features of copper.

### Overview

This sample project provides a performant solution for the following business workflow:

0. an application needs to handle many workflows in a performant way and integrates copper-engine
1. the copper engine provides the workflow instance
2. Each workflow sends requests to an external asynchronous adapter. 
3. the adapter provides synchronous a correlationID for later references.
4. After some time the adapter sends back the response data together with the correlationID
5. the copper-engine continues the execution of the corresponding workflow
6. the workflow handles the response data.

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 7 or 8 
- gradle 2.0+
- git
- Console, Eclipse or Intellij Idea

```sh
git clone https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-starter.git
cd copper-starter
gradle assemble
```

	Note: You can use ./gradlew or ./gradlew.bat instead of gradle if you don't have gradle already installed.


##### test run in eclipse

	gradle eclipse

- import in eclipse as Java Project
- run HelloWorldTestApplication.java

##### test run in Intellij IDEA

- import in IDEA as Java Project
- run HelloWorldTestApplication.java

##### test run in console
	 gradle --info runHello

If the test run succeeds, your are prepared for the tutorial.

### Getting Started Tutorial

##### Structure of the copper-starter project

copper-starter contains two examples:

- a very simple HelloWorld Workflow:
	- send 5000 asyncronous "Hello World" request to a mocked "external" Adapter.
	- receive 5000 answer call backs
	- uses the transient copper-engine: all workflow instances are stored in memory.

- a more realistic orchestration example:
    - engine, sender and adapter are separated java programs
    - persistent copper engine stores all threads in derby database
