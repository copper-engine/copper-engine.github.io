                <p>The <span style="font-weight:bold">COPPER</span> source code is on <span style="font-weight:bold">GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine" target="_blank">https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine</a></span></p>

                <h3>Stable</h3>

                <p>The current <span style="font-weight:bold">stable</span> release is <span style="font-weight:bold">3.0</span>.<br/>
                    You can download it <span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine/releases/tag/3.0">here</a></span>.<br/>
                    See <a href="https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine/blob/3.0/WHATSNEW.txt">what's new</a>.</p>

                <p>COPPER is on <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.copper-engine%22">Maven Central</a>, too. You may use the following to include the COPPER core workflow engine in your <span style="font-weight: bold">Maven</span> project:
                {% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.copper-engine</groupId>
    <artifactId>copper-coreengine</artifactId>
    <version>3.0</version>
</dependency>{% endhighlight %}
                If you are using <span style="font-weight: bold">Gradle</span>, simply add the following to your <code>dependencies</code> section:
                {% highlight groovy %} compile 'org.copper-engine:copper-coreengine:3.0' {% endhighlight %}
                If you are using COPPER with Spring you also need to include <code>copper-spring</code>:
                {% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.copper-engine</groupId>
    <artifactId>copper-spring</artifactId>
    <version>3.0</version>
</dependency> {% endhighlight %}
                and likewise for Gradle:
                {% highlight groovy %} compile 'org.copper-engine:copper-spring:3.0' {% endhighlight %}
                </p>
