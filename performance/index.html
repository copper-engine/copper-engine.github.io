        <h1>COPPER Performance test</h1>

		<p>
		COPPER workflows are 100% pure Java so there is no performance penalty when processing data or calling partner systems in comparison to plain Java because it IS just Java.
		COPPER simply offers a runtime environment with processing queues, processor threads and a model for handling asynchronous responses efficiently.
		Also, in a persistent engine, COPPER offers crash safety, i.e. if the hosting server crashes, e.g. due to a power failure, the engine resumes the
		previously running workflow instances at their last checkpoint. COPPER Checkpoints are written whenever a workflow executes <code>Workflow.savepoint</code> or <code>Workflow.wait</code>.
		<code>Workflow.savepoint</code> simply persists the current state of the workflow instance to the underlying database and continues later on.
		<code>Workflow.wait</code> asynchronously waits for a response, e.g. when calling an asynchronous service of partner system X that returns a correlationId 'cid' for the final response,
		it's good practice in COPPER to wait for this response asynchronously using <code>Workflow.wait(WaitMode.FIRST,0,cid)</code>. <code>Workflow.wait(...)</code> writes a checkpoint and registers the
		workflow instance for waiting for a response with a particular correlationId. As soon as the response arrives (using "engine.notify(...)</code>) the workflow instance is resumed and
		the response is made available in it.
		</p>

		</p>
		So when we are talking about performance in COPPER there are two separate concerns:
		<ul>
			<li>Processing performance</li>
			<li>Database performance</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Procssing performance</h2>
		As stated before, workflows are written in Java which is processed by the underlying JVM, which is proven to be fast.
		The runtime environment is mostly using standard Java technologies from the java.util.concurrent package or simply <code>synchronized</code> and <code>Object.wait/notify</code>, so from our point of view
		there is no need to prove that this is fast.

		<h2>Database performance</h2>
		Most COPPER users are using a persistent engine, because they want their workflow instances to survive crashes, downtimes and restarts.
		So, the two major questions about COPPER database performance are
		<ul>
			<li>What is the latency to write a checkpoint, e.g using <code>Workflow.savepoint<code>?</li>
			<li>What is the maximum number of checkpoint per second a system can handle, in other words what is the maximum throughput?</li>
		</ul>

		To answer these questions, we have introduced an official COPPER performance test suite.
		This suite offers two different performance tests:

		<h3>Latency</h3>
		<p>
		This test measures the average latency for executing a checkpoint in an otherwise idle system.
		To do so, the test executes workflow
		<a href="https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine/blob/master/projects/copper-performance-test/src/main/java/org/copperengine/performancetest/workflows/SavepointPerfTestWorkflow.java">SavepointPerfTestWorkflow</a>
		that invokes <code>Workflow.savepoint()</code> ten times, measuring the latency each time.
		The workflow is started several times (50 times by default) and the averagy latency time if all executions is measured.
		</p>

		<h3>Throughput</h3>
		<p>
		This test measures the average number of checkpoins (using Workflow.wait/Engine.notify) a system can handle as follows:
		It starts a large number of
		<a href="https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine/blob/master/projects/copper-performance-test/src/main/java/org/copperengine/performancetest/workflows/WaitNotifyPerfTestWorkflow.java">WaitNotifyPerfTestWorkflow</a>
		workflows
		and measures the time until the engine has completed their execution.
		Each of the WaitNotifyPerfTestWorkflow workflows simulates the communication with an external partner system by calling an
		<a href="https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine/blob/master/projects/copper-performance-test/src/main/java/org/copperengine/performancetest/impl/MockAdapter.java">adapter mock</a>
		ten times. Each time its waiting for the response using <code>Workflow.wait</code>, so the workflow instances' state is persisted for ten times (plus one time when the initial workflow instance
		is enqueued at the beginning).
		At the end of the test, the average number of wait/notify cycles (checkpoints) is processed an printed on System.out.
		</p>

		<p>
		Executing the performance test is quite simple - its just an executable jarfile containing everything you need.
		It can handle all currently supported database systems, which are Apache Cassandra, Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, H2 and Derby.
		There are various configuration parameters available for the test - see its usage.
		The test and a description how to start it can be found here
		<a href="https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine/blob/master/projects/copper-performance-test/PERFORMANCE_TEST_HOWTO.MD">PERFORMANCE_TEST_HOWTO</a>
		</p>

		<p>
		We will publish the results of some performance tests later on this site.
